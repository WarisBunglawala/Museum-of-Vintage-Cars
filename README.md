# Museum of Vintage Cars

It is a fine-looking responsive project built with Bootstrap 4. Main goal of this project was to make the grid responsive and change it accordingly to the screen size. It also does some cool stuff to the navbar. 

Project uses images and content from the internet it is a demo project for the learning purpose. 

## Technology

- HTML 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4 

## Additional Material
To show the use case of the project that I have built previously, I have used my pricing panel project here as in ticket booking panel. this way I not only learned to achieve the better and faster results but I also learned to handle the dependencies between two different projects.
